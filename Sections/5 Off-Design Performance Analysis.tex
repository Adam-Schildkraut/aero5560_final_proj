\section{Off-Design Performance Analysis}

Trim the aircraft at flight conditions different to the initial conditions you have used so far, but maintain the same controller you have designed, and discuss how the performance of your controller changes at these different conditions. You can choose a couple of conditions (e.g. one condition at a faster airspeed, and one condition at a lower airspeed) and show the equivalent linear system responses. Study how the closed-loop poles move in the S-plane as you change the trim conditions.
